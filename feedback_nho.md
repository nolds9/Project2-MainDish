## Project Workflow

**Does Not Meet Expectations...Yet**

Looking for a `readme` about your process, with a planning directory containing evidence of your planning, such as user stories, ERDs, wireframes! Also, please include set-up instructions for this application. In general, I would like to see more commits as way to track progress and progression of code.

## Technical Requirements

**Meets Expectations**

Nice job implementing user authentication, and setting up your associations. Those nested attributes on the models and forms must have been tricky! Would like to see you incorporate more models to tackle your next features!

## Creativity / Interface

**Meets Expectations**

Really like how you went out a built an app to solve a problem that's personal and applicable for you.  What are some of the next steps to build on this work? How could you implement a  `favorites` model? Overall, this app's design and interface really fit well with the purpose/functionality.

## Deployment and Functionality

**Meets Expectations**

Good job hitting your MVP, app is mostly functional, would like to see you try to deploy if you have not yet already, and I'd be happy to pair on that if you wanted. Would like to see you come back to this and keep expanding on this project!
